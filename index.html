        This is me praying that <br />
        This was the very first page <br />
        Not where the story line ends <br />
        My thought will echo your name, until I see you again <br />
        These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon <br />
        I was enchanted to meet you <br />
        Please don't be in love with someone else <br />
        Please don't have somebody waiting for you <br />
